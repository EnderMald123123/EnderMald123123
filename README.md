-  Some question : have you ever wondering why when you are at young age you always dreaming something in your next future but when you grow up and being succesfully human you will no longer dreaming it again.
-   Answer : Its because when you are always thinking about getting that job in the future when you grow up , but in each human of ourself ,  not all job that are perfectly fits for all of us , so in each of people body cells their have to find a way to find your perfectly job to make sure you live well and happy , so dont regret what body do to you dont blame them why , their help us alot , they help me to change , how to being a perfectly human , so if you are trying to thanks someone always remember you have to thanks your bodyself first
