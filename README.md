-  Some question : have you ever wondering why when you are at young age you always dreaming something in your next future but when you grow up and being succesfully human you will no longer dreaming it again.
-   Answer : Its because when you are always thinking about getting that job in the future when you grow up , but in each human of ourself ,  not all job that are perfectly fits for all of us , so in each of people body cells their have to find a solution to help  you and other to find a perfectly job to make sure you live well and happy , so dont forget what body did to you and dont blame them why , their help all of us alot , they help us to change and how to being a perfectly human , so if you are trying to thanks someone always remember you have to thanks to yourself first
